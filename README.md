This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to data frame subsetting. The `bug.R` file contains code that incorrectly uses the assignment operator `=` instead of the equality operator `==` when subsetting a data frame. This leads to unexpected results. The `bugSolution.R` file provides the corrected code.
